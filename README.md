# PDF TO WORD CONVERTER
## Overview
The goal of this software is to convert pdf files into docx files where:

 - Notes on the pdf (taken with normal software such as Adobe Acrobat,
   Edge etc.) are converted into editable text in word. 
- The pdf page becomes an image in word.

The final result is then an editable docx file where for each page of the pdf there will be a docx page with the annotations in text format and a screenshot of the pdf page they were on.
The image below shows just the final result.


For example given the following pdf in input

<img src="https://github.com/RenatoEsposito1999/PDF-to-Docx-converter-with-annotations/blob/main/Resources/pdf%20input.png" width="500" height="500">


We get the following docx as output


<img src="https://github.com/RenatoEsposito1999/PDF-to-Docx-converter-with-annotations/blob/main/Resources/docx%20output.png" width="500" height="500">

**N.B**: It's possible through an option within the software to clean the images by eliminating the annotations before taking the screenshot, in this case we get the following output:
