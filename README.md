## Overview
***
The goal of this software is to convert pdf files into docx files where:

 - Notes on the pdf (taken with normal software such as Adobe Acrobat,
   Edge etc.) are converted into editable text in word. 
- The pdf page becomes an image in word.

The final result is then an editable docx file where for each page of the pdf there will be a docx page with the annotations in text format and a screenshot of the pdf page they were on.
The image below shows just the final result.


For example given the following pdf in input
<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/RenatoEsposito1999/PDF-to-Docx-converter-with-annotations/blob/main/Resources/pdf%20input.png" width="500" height="500">
</p>

We get the following docx as output

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/RenatoEsposito1999/PDF-to-Docx-converter-with-annotations/blob/main/Resources/docx%20output.png" width="500" height="500"></p>

**N.B**: It's possible through an option within the software to clean the images by eliminating the annotations before taking the screenshot, in this case we get the following output:

- **The first checkbox**: if checked it will be possible to select an entire folder. This will be inspected and will convert all pdf's inside.
- **The first checkbox**: if checked it will delete the clipboard from the pdf page before taking the screenshot. (**WARNING: this option will not modify the original pdf in any way so the notes will continue to be there at the end of the process**)
- **The third element**: allows you to select the pdf/folder containing the pdfs.
